This is the technical user manual for the
[MICADO](https://www.micado-project.eu/) data analysis pipeline (DAP), which has
taken the form of an [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package. All scientific
details of the implemented probabilistic models are provided in the
[corresponding journal paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nucengdes.2024.113257).

# The R package

A binary version of the {micado.dap} R package was distributed as a `.zip`
archive, during the project, together with this HTML manual. The package can be
installed from the archive from your R console as follows:

```{r}
#| label: install
#| eval: false
if (!require(pak)) install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("local::/path/to/micado.dap_0.2.0.zip")
```

where `/path/to/micado.dap_0.2.0.zip` is a relative or absolute path to the
file. Alternatively, the package can be installed from its GitHub repository,
with:

```{r}
#| label: install2
#| eval: false
if (!require(pak)) install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("rogiersbart/micado.dap")
```

This does require a recent version of R, and the corresponding R developer
toolchain for windows [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools).
Installing the package will also install the required dependencies from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/), if an
internet connection is available. Once this has completed successfully, the
package can be loaded and attached, so it is ready for use, with the following:

```{r}
#| label: library
library(micado.dap)
```

This induces a start-up message to appear, which includes the package version
number, as well as a copyright notice. If you get a message saying that CmdStan
cannot be found, try to follow the [{cmdstanr} setup instructions](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html).

::: {.callout-note}
The MICADO DAP is compiled for a 64-bit Windows operating system. In theory, it
is possible to use the package on other platforms, but a different package
binary would have to be created in that case, and the
[Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) models would have to be recompiled as well. This
has not been tested.
:::

# The measurement data

The MICADO DAP has been targeting probabilistic interpretation of two potential
waste streams, or so-called "virtual cases", that are referred to as "Virtual
Case 1" (VC1) and "Virtual Case 3" (VC3). While the data related to the
different measurement technologies and their respective efficiencies are also
part of the package, only the "true" measurement results are exposed to the
package user. These are available as R objects with a `vc1_` or `vc3_` prefix
indicating the targeted waste stream, and `gamma`, `pncc`, or `ancc` as suffix
indicating the measurement technology:

```{r}
#| label: data
vc1_gamma
vc1_pncc
vc1_ancc
vc3_gamma
vc3_pncc
```

# The probabilistic models

The probabilistic models part of the MICADO DAP can be invoked in different
ways, depending on where they should run, and how a request is made:

* A local R client can access the `vc1_model()` and `vc3_model()` R functions
  directly, and there is no need for an HTTP API,
* For remote use, the DAP can be started on the server with `dap_start()`, so
  that
  * A remote R client can access the HTTP API through `dap_request()`, and
  * A remote HTTP client can directly send HTTP requests to the server.

## Local R client

Local use of the MICADO DAP, without the need for an HTTP API, is only possible
from R. The `vc1_model()` and `vc3_model()` functions accept `gamma`, `pncc` and
`ancc` (only for VC1) data, a `legacy` flag indicating whether detailed 
knowledge on the Plutonium isotopic vector is present or not, and a number of 
`cores` to parallellize the calculations:

```{r}
#| label: models
#| cache: true
cores <- 2
vc1_result <- vc1_model(
  gamma = vc1_gamma,
  pncc = vc1_pncc,
  ancc = vc1_ancc,
  cores = cores
)
vc1_result_legacy <- vc1_model(
  gamma = vc1_gamma,
  pncc = vc1_pncc,
  ancc = vc1_ancc,
  cores = cores,
  legacy = TRUE
)
vc3_result <- vc3_model(
  gamma = vc3_gamma,
  pncc = vc3_pncc,
  cores = cores
)
vc3_result_legacy <- vc3_model(
  gamma = vc3_gamma,
  pncc = vc3_pncc,
  cores = cores,
  legacy = TRUE
)
```

The corresponding result objects have the following structure:

```{r}
#| label: results
str(vc1_result, give.attr = FALSE)
vc1_result$masses # mean, sd, q025, q975 for all nuclides
vc1_result$diagnostics # converged: whether all rhat < 1.02
```

The `masses` data frame contains the mean and standard deviation of the
different radionuclide masses, and the 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles. The
`diagnostics` list contains:

- `converged`: a logical flag indicating whether all parameter Rhat values were
  below a threshold of 1.02, and sampling from the posterior has converged,
- `p_gamma`: a posterior predictive p-value for the gross counts, based on the $\chi^2$-discrepancy,
  which, if close to zero, indicates that at least one of the observed data
  points is really in a tail of its corresponding posterior predictive distribution (*i.e.* we have outliers, or our model may not be very adequate for interpreting the data at hand),
  while if close to one, it indicates that the fit to the data is very good, and
  we may even be overestimating uncertainty,
- `p_pncc`: the posterior predictive p-value for the PNCC reals per second
- `p_ancc`: the posterior predictive p-value for the ANCC counts per second

When using the R client, the results come with additional attributes: The
`CmdStanMCMC` model fit object, and the JSON required for DigiWaste Bridge. They
can be obtained using `get_fit()` and `get_json()` respectively. The
fit object allows for more in depth investigation of the probabilistic model
run, *e.g.*:

```{r}
#| label: fit
#| cache: true
get_fit(vc3_result)$time()
```

Similarly, the JSON required for DigiWaste Bridge can be accessed through:

```{r}
#| label: json
get_json(vc3_result)
```

This JSON can be written to disk for the manual uploads as follows:

```{r}
#| label: bridge
#| eval: false
write_json <- \(x, y) get_json(x) |> writeLines(y, useBytes = TRUE)
vc1_result |> write_json("json/vc1_result.json")
vc1_result_legacy |> write_json("json/vc1_result_legacy.json")
vc3_result |> write_json("json/vc3_result.json")
vc3_result_legacy |> write_json("json/vc3_result_legacy.json")
```

## Remote R client

Remote use is made possible by an HTTP API, for which the R package has a set
of wrapper functions, all using the `dap_` prefix. On the machine that should
serve the MICADO DAP, the HTTP API can be started with:

```{r}
#| label: start
dap_start(cores = 4)
```

where the number of cores dedicated to the MICADO DAP can be specified. Only
values 1 (run all chains sequentially), 2 (run 2 times 2 MCMC chains in
parallel) and 4 (run 4 MCMC chains in parallel) make sense here. On the client,
a request can then be submitted as follows:

```{r}
#| label: request
#| cache: true
result <- dap_request(
  gamma = vc3_gamma,
  pncc = vc3_pncc,
  case = "vc3",
  ip = "localhost"
)
str(result, give.attr = FALSE)
```

where the IP address should be that of the server. Currently, port 8000 is
always used. The DAP server can always be terminated explicitly by:

```{r}
#| label: stop
dap_stop()
```

When using `dap_request()`, the results are always returned in an R-native
format. When submitting requests directly through an HTTP client, the preferred
DigiWaste JSON structure is returned instead.

::: {.callout-warning}
Note that we just use `ip = "localhost"` here for demonstration purposes. In 
practice, when using the same machine as R client and server, it makes more
sense to use the R API (as explained in "Local R client"), than to go through
the HTTP API.
:::

## Remote HTTP client

The original idea was that the DigiWaste system would send HTTP requests to the
MICADO DAP, with a JSON string containing the required inputs, and accepting the
outputs resulting from the probabilistic interpretation of the measurement data.
We illustrate here how this would work when doing an HTTP request directly,
rather than using the above R client API (which does the same in the background,
but receives the results in a different format).

First we again need to start the server:

```{r}
dap_start(cores = 4)
```

Then we can construct the required JSON:

```{r}
request_json <- jsonlite::toJSON(
  list(
    gamma = vc3_gamma,
    pncc = vc3_pncc,
    ancc = NULL,
    case = "vc3",
    legacy = FALSE
  ),
  digits = NA,
  pretty = TRUE
)
```

In appendix we provide the full JSON body to make clear what structure is
required. Finally we can submit the request, and retrieve the DAP results, again
in JSON format:

```{r}
#| label: post
#| cache: true
result <- httr::POST("http://localhost:8000/dap", body = request_json) |>
  httr::content()
dap_stop()
cat(result)
```

# Appendix {.unnumbered}

## HTTP request JSON body {.unnumbered}

```{r}
#| label: complete-json-vc1-all-data
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "VC1"
jsonlite::toJSON(
  list(
    gamma = vc1_gamma,
    pncc = vc1_pncc,
    ancc = vc1_ancc,
    case = "vc1",
    legacy = FALSE
  ),
  digits = NA,
  pretty = TRUE
)
```

```{r}
#| label: complete-json-vc3-all-data
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "VC3"
jsonlite::toJSON(
  list(
    gamma = vc3_gamma,
    pncc = vc3_pncc,
    ancc = NULL,
    case = "vc3",
    legacy = FALSE
  ),
  digits = NA,
  pretty = TRUE
)
```
